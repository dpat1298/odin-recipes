            <li>1 stick cinnamon</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For garnish (this is where pho soup shines!)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>4 green onion</li>
            <li>2 fresh jalapeno peppers</li>
            <li>1 bunch fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>1 bunch Thai basil leaves</li>
            <li>1 cup fresh bean sprouts</li>
            <li>2 limes</li>
            <li>Sriracha hot sauce, or additional red pepper chili paste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a large dry pot over medium heat add the onion halves and ginger pieces. Cook for 4 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Add the broth, water, coriander, clove, fish sauce, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, chili garlic paste, cinnamon stick and a pinch of fresh cracked salt and pepper to the pot. Bring to a slow boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, prepare noodles according to package instructions. Once soft, drain, rinse and set aside.</li>
            <li>Ready the garnishes in individual small bowls for serving: cilantro, basil, green onions, bean sprouts, lime wedges and sliced chilies.</li>
            <li>1-5 minutes before the broth is done cooking, add desired meat to the broth to cook, just until done (2-3 minutes for raw, thinly sliced chicken or pork, 1-2 minutes for shrimp or thinly sliced steak).</li>
            <li>Discard the ginger, clove, cinnamon stick and onion pieces from the pot.</li>
            <li>Divide the noodles among bowls; ladle broth on top (and meat). Add desired toppings.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p><strong>Protien:</strong> It's important to slice the meat as thinly as possible, against the grain.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Beef Pho (phở bò):</strong> 1/2 pound sirloin steak, flank steak or brisket, sliced very thinly and seasoned with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Chicken Pho (phở gà):</strong> Slice 1-2 boneless, skinless breasts into very thin pieces, against the grain. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Pork Pho:</strong> Season a 1 lb pork tenderloin with salt and pepper and sear in a little bit of oil in a very hot pan until browned on all sides (about 10 minute). Allow to rest while broth cooks and then slice into very thin slices.</li>
            <li><strong>Shrimp:</strong> raw, shells removed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>To substitute leftover/cooked meat:</strong> This is a great recipe to use up leftover cooked meat like rotisserie chicken, shredded pork, or beef. Add cooked meat to the bowls with the noodles and ladle hot broth over it. Then add toppings.</p>
        <p><strong>Vegetarian/vegan pho:</strong> Substitute vegetable or mushroom stock, substitute sautéed mushrooms and baby bok choy for the meat, and omit the fish sauce.</p>
        <p><strong>Make ahead instructions:</strong> The broth can be made several days ahead of time. Allow it to cool, cover it and store it in the refrigerator. Reheat on the stove.</p>
        <p><strong>Freezing instructions:</strong> Freeze only the broth. Allow it to cool completely and store in a freezer safe bag or container for 4-5 months.</p>
        <p><strong>Instant Pot Pho:</strong> Cook noodles according to instructions. Assemble toppings. Turn IP to sauté setting. Add onion and ginger and cook for a few minutes. Turn pot off. Add broth, coriander, cloves, fish sauce, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, chili garlic paste, cinnamon stick and a pinch of fresh cracked salt and pepper to the pot. Turn valve to sealed, apply lid and cook on manual/high pressure for 10 minutes with a controlled quick release after the timer beeps. Turn to saute and add shrimp, steak pork, or chicken, cooking until done. Assemble bowls as directed.</p>
        <p><strong>Slow Cooker Pho:</strong> Cook onion and ginger in a hot skillet, then add to slow cooker with broth, coriander, cloves, fish sauce, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, chili garlic paste, cinnamon stick and a pinch of fresh cracked salt and pepper. (For chicken pho, add skinless chicken thighs and cook in slow cooker with broth). Cook on low for 6-8 hours or high for 3-4 hours. Discard the ginger, clove, cinnamon stick and onion. Prepare the noodles according to instructions. Assemble toppings.</p>
